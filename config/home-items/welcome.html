  Our ultimate aim of this module is to provide reporting and help you make better promotional planning decisions with a single, intuitive
  tool.
</p>
<p>
  This brand new module is being developed using data science and contains the most advanced algorithms Acme have ever built to analyse the
  financial and customer impacts of promotions.
</p>
<p>
  The focus of this first development stage is to give you a comprehensive view of how your promotions have performed so that you can learn
  more from past promotions including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Financial metrics to show you how a promotion performed, and what the true, net impact of the promotion was on the category.
  </li>
  <li>
    Customer metrics to show you who bought a promotion and how it changed their behaviour, helping you to target your promotional plans
    to the right customers.
  </li>
</ul>
